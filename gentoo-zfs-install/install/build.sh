# Copy this script to the gentoo livecd environment.  You must
# have an HTTP server setup which provides access to the stage3, portage snapshot, kernel-config, and chroot-script.sh.
#
# Call this script with the base URL of this server as the only
# parameter.  IE:
#   ./build.sh http://192.168.42.42/~user/zfs
#
#
# Layout of this script:
#
# This script loads the zfs driver, partitions disks, and creates 
# the zpool.  It downloads the initial stage files & portage snapshots 
# and untars them into what will be the chroot environment.  Finally 
# it copies chroot-script.sh into the chroot, chroot's, and executes 
# that script.
#
# chroot-script.sh does most of the gentoo install work of emerging
# packages, compiling the kernel etc.  Once most of the setup work
# is done, chroot-script.sh will drop to a shell inside the chroot
# and give you an opportunity emerge any addititonal packages or
# do anything else you might need to do in the chroot.  
#
# You should at this point SET YOUR ROOT PASSWORD! =)

# When you exit that shell, chroot-script.sh will exit, and 
# you'll be returned to the final part of this build.sh.  
# At that point, this script will umount filesystems and 
# prepare the system to reboot.  You will be dropped back to 
# your shell one more time, and you'll have a chance to make 
# any final adjustments.  Reboot, remove your install media 
# from the system, and with any luck you'll end up in your
# shiny new ZFS root Gentoo system.
