# This is an example chrony keys file.  You should copy it to /etc/chrony/chrony.keys
# after editing it to set up the key(s) you want to use.  It should be readable
# only by root or the user chronyd drops the root privileges to.  In most
# situations, you will require a single key (the 'commandkey') so that you can
# supply a password to chronyc to enable you to modify chronyd's operation
# whilst it is running.

# Examples of valid keys:

# The keys should be random for maximum security.  If you wanted to use a key
# with ID 1 as your commandkey (i.e. chronyc password) you would put
# "commandkey 1" into chrony.conf.  If no commandkey is present in the keys
# file and the generatecommandkey directive is specified in chrony.conf,
# a random commandkey will be generated and added to the keys file
# automatically on chronyd start.

# You might want to define more keys if you use the authentication facility
# in the network time protocol to authenticate request/response packets between
# trusted clients and servers.
