2014-06-10 12:28:14	Ghent	dangergrrl: are you doing wiki stuff about boot & zfs?
2014-06-10 12:31:28	ℹ 	durarara is now known as alicef
2014-06-10 12:32:48	dangergrrl	i'm reading wiki docs, then will be working on it
2014-06-10 12:34:28	dangergrrl	i've actually never rtfm so i'm doing that first
2014-06-10 12:36:04	<--	dk_dd (~dk@natpool.web-factory.de) has quit (Quit: Leaving.)
2014-06-10 12:37:14	dangergrrl	i think i'm adding back the recommendation to install a syslogd/klogd to the end of the main install guide; it was on the old one and it's something i have been neglecting to do
2014-06-10 12:37:34	Ghent	should always have a syslog
2014-06-10 12:37:44	dangergrrl	and imo its something that should be done before the first reboot
2014-06-10 12:37:49	Ghent	yep
2014-06-10 12:37:58	Ghent	hard to figure out what's wrong with no logging :p
2014-06-10 12:38:14	dangergrrl	so it belongs in install, not "first steps"
2014-06-10 12:40:21	dangergrrl	i'm wanting a wikilike thing for my own stuff but i would like xml and interactive multiuser editing a la google docs, (i suppose wiki markup could be made into an xml dtd with no change except syntax)
2014-06-10 12:40:56	angry_vincent	metalog is wht Funtoo recommends
2014-06-10 12:41:07	Ghent	i <3 metalog
2014-06-10 12:43:42	dangergrrl	i like offering choices though, i know some here really like syslog-ng too
2014-06-10 12:44:25	dangergrrl	and i think i should write something somewhere about *how* i found why my system wasn't booting with zfs+grsec
2014-06-10 12:44:44	dangergrrl	i know how to do it, apparently not everyone does
2014-06-10 12:45:05	Ghent	dangergrrl: did you end up finding a solution?
2014-06-10 12:45:23	dangergrrl	i used progressively sh -x, then strace, then dmesg
2014-06-10 12:46:50	Ghent	dangergrrl: what ended up being the problem?
2014-06-10 12:47:36	dangergrrl	Ghent, http://bpaste.net/show/Wnkm59nNngYsRLrkTueq/
2014-06-10 12:48:05	dangergrrl	PAX_SIZE_OBVERFLOW is not compatible with zfs
2014-06-10 12:48:12	dangergrrl	this is a zfs bug imo
2014-06-10 12:49:12	dangergrrl	but my vm booted fine with grsec once i disabled that option
2014-06-10 12:49:29	Ghent	cool

2014-06-10 12:50:43	dangergrrl	so i'll document that somewhere but not in install instructions for zfs wo suitable rescue boot or console or /boot on another fs, i added grsec later
2014-06-10 12:51:10	dangergrrl	i'm also going to look at dracut but not yet

2014-06-10 12:53:40	dangergrrl	and i still have no clue why grub-install with zfs on / works on my server but not on my vm, but i have a workaround (inelegant as it may be)
2014-06-10 12:58:27	dangergrrl	on my vm i have to have the grub.cfg on /dev/md0 ext4 but the rest of /boot is in zfs, so kernels and initramfs are in the normal place but the grub.cfg is not
2014-06-10 12:58:44	dangergrrl	grub.cfg is in /mnt/rescue/boot/grub :(

2014-06-10 14:04:21	Edelwin	a greek friend of mine would savage you for such words
2014-06-10 14:10:09	dangergrrl	i like writing with unicode characters :)  i have yet to try to claim a legal document does not refer to me based on 7bitification of my name though (or worse 5 bitification like the DMV does)
2014-06-10 14:13:41	dangergrrl	i'd rather stay here and do something useful but i think i'm gonna grab lunch and go smile at people to raise funds for my safari and panix bills and my prescriptions
2014-06-10 14:14:33	dangergrrl	yes, i panhandle and actually deposit the money in the bank to pay my bills, someone give me some better work and i'll do it if i can sit at my computer in starbucks or wherever
2014-06-10 14:15:54	dangergrrl	i'll probably sleep when i get in tonight and do some useful wiki stuff tomorrow; i have a few things i now know how to do that i'll start on tomorrow

2014-06-10 14:17:30	dangergrrl	but when my server boots with grsec and i've documented the stuff i've already done i get 1 more gaming day... balance in all things

2014-06-12 00:01:09	ZealotForSpeed	so I copied my root to another computer, I reset the root password. For some reason root is not the owner of everything even though the permissions havent changed.

2014-06-12 00:17:01	ZealotForSpeed	Ghent, that's the thing, it is owned by root
2014-06-12 00:17:19	ZealotForSpeed	permissions weren't actually changed.
2014-06-12 00:17:47	Ghent	I'm confused... you said root is not the owner of everything
2014-06-12 00:17:50	ZealotForSpeed	I think I did a straight cp -r /* to /new/root
2014-06-12 00:18:14	ZealotForSpeed	the sys boots. everything appears normal.
2014-06-12 00:18:26	Ghent	i nthe future, you'll want to use the -p flag (retain permissions)
2014-06-12 00:18:32	Ghent	even better is the -a flag
2014-06-12 00:18:41	Ghent	retain permissions and timestamps
2014-06-12 00:19:18	ZealotForSpeed	when I created a new user, and tried to start x I got some weird "cannon open virtual console 7" error
2014-06-12 00:19:56	ZealotForSpeed	Yeah I thought about that after discovering this issue
2014-06-12 00:20:12	Ghent	ZealotForSpeed: yeah, with just the -r flag, your permissions on a lot of things are probably broken
2014-06-12 00:20:38	Ghent	especially in /dev
2014-06-12 00:20:47	ZealotForSpeed	Ghent, ok I'll recopy root
2014-06-12 00:21:06	ZealotForSpeed	but why would -r when copying as root change permissions?
2014-06-12 00:21:07	Ghent	use -a
2014-06-12 00:21:17	Ghent	because -r is just recursive
2014-06-12 00:21:31	Ghent	so it's going to write everything as root
2014-06-12 00:21:43	Ghent	regardless if it needs to be something else
2014-06-12 00:21:50	ZealotForSpeed	ah, right right
2014-06-12 00:21:56	Shinigami-Sama	lots of things are root:$somegroup
2014-06-12 00:22:01	Ghent	right
2014-06-12 00:22:13	ZealotForSpeed	duh
2014-06-12 00:22:48	Ghent	also use -v if you wanna see nice output so you can see progress :)
2014-06-12 00:22:58	Ghent	cp -av / /new/root
2014-06-12 00:23:24	ZealotForSpeed	I rarly verbose
2014-06-12 00:23:28	ZealotForSpeed	rarely
2014-06-12 00:23:34	Ghent	same
2014-06-12 00:23:51	ZealotForSpeed	seems like verbose slows copies
2014-06-12 00:24:06	Ghent	yea, it can, if the terminal is too slow for the output
2014-06-12 00:24:15	ZealotForSpeed	exactly
2014-06-12 00:24:53	Shinigami-Sama	don't use cp either if you want it to go quickly
2014-06-12 00:24:57	Shinigami-Sama	pipe tar
2014-06-12 00:25:12	Shinigami-Sama	cp is really slow when moving across filesystems
2014-06-12 00:25:24	Shinigami-Sama	as it is block based
2014-06-12 00:25:27	Shinigami-Sama	tar uses streams
2014-06-12 00:26:07	ZealotForSpeed	rsync?
2014-06-12 00:26:27	Ghent	Shinigami-Sama: care to show a full command?  (for reference)
2014-06-12 00:28:14	ZealotForSpeed	What I did differently this time is go from a zfs partition to ext4 via cp -r
2014-06-12 00:28:25	ZealotForSpeed	normally I just work with zfs
2014-06-12 00:29:05	ZealotForSpeed	I don't have to concern myself with permisisons when doing zfs send | zfs recv
2014-06-12 00:30:15	Shinigami-Sama	tar -cpO / | tar -C /new/root -xp -f -
2014-06-12 00:30:17	Shinigami-Sama	should work
2014-06-12 00:30:29	ZealotForSpeed	I prefer zfs on an ssd and a more modern computer. In this case neither is available. (pentium core 2 duo laptop)
2014-06-12 00:31:13	ZealotForSpeed	is rsync block based?
2014-06-12 00:32:03	Shinigami-Sama	Ghent: http://blog.extracheese.org/2010/05/the-tar-pipe.html
2014-06-12 00:32:05	Shinigami-Sama	there we go
2014-06-12 00:32:39	Shinigami-Sama	I used this method when I was playing musical partitions when I migrated from windows
2014-06-12 00:33:04	Shinigami-Sama	it is over twice as performant as cp across mulitple terabytes of data
2014-06-12 00:34:41	Ghent	Shinigami-Sama: that is a fantastic read
2014-06-12 00:34:54	Shinigami-Sama	isnt  it
2014-06-12 00:35:00	Shinigami-Sama	I always come back to this
2014-06-12 00:35:01	Ghent	Tar pipes are mostly obsolete, but far too awesome to be forgotten!
2014-06-12 00:35:15	Ghent	hmm, I wonder why they would be considered obsolete when they're so useful?
2014-06-12 00:35:24	Shinigami-Sama	I can never rmember the whole command but I remember enough of  the commmand that this comes up first resule when I google my tar monstorsity
2014-06-12 00:35:32	Ghent	Shinigami-Sama: lol
2014-06-12 00:35:39	Ghent	I'll definitely be tucking this gem away
2014-06-12 00:35:44	Shinigami-Sama	because we have newer tools that acomplish the same thing
2014-06-12 00:35:56	Shinigami-Sama	like rsysc
2014-06-12 00:36:07	Ghent	rsync uses streams as well?
2014-06-12 00:36:20	Shinigami-Sama	its blocks but its more efficient
2014-06-12 00:37:51	Shinigami-Sama	Ghent: if you want *JUST* root
2014-06-12 00:38:07	Shinigami-Sama	no /dev /sys/ /tmp /mnt.... yo ucan add a flag to the first tar
2014-06-12 00:38:47	Shinigami-Sama	 --one-file-system
2014-06-12 00:40:19	Ghent	yeah

2014-06-12 11:07:51	yann-kaelig	I finally update to eudev but that was not really fun. I emerge -C lvm2 udev virtual/udev then @preserved-rebuild , a @world and @x11-module-rebuild, and reboot

2014-06-12 11:10:12	dangergrrl	i hate it when i don't notice emerge sync telling me that and things break
2014-06-12 11:10:30	yann-kaelig	but my jack-audio-connection-kit was downgrade from 1.9.9.5 to 0.121
2014-06-12 11:11:01	dangergrrl	i have selective vision and it is often useful for getting to what i am interested in
2014-06-12 11:11:13	dangergrrl	but i don't see what i'm not looking for
2014-06-12 11:16:41	yann-kaelig	well I emerge -C jack-audio-connection-kit 0.121 and I could reinstall the 1.9.9.5
2014-06-12 11:16:48	yann-kaelig	I hate emerge -C ^^
2014-06-12 11:20:46	funfool	yann-kaelig, is there a problem with 0.121.3-r1, looks like only option in tree

2014-06-12 11:25:33	dangergrrl	i figured somehow the "kick me" sign someone stuck n my back in grade school had never fallen off...
2014-06-12 11:25:47	funfool	yann-kaelig, proper way is to remove udev and then emerge virtual/udev
2014-06-12 11:26:36	funfool	then etc-update and emerge @preserved-rebuild, that will pull eudev in
2014-06-12 11:26:37	dangergrrl	funfool, portage seems to be saying it is going to do that for me all by itself, is that a workstation only ordering problem?
2014-06-12 11:27:30	funfool	dangergrrl, maybe portage is getting smarter?
2014-06-12 11:27:47	Edelwin	damn
2014-06-12 11:27:57	Edelwin	funfool: it starts getting smarter
2014-06-12 11:28:01	dangergrrl	it's pulling eudev then virtual/udev then removing udev
2014-06-12 11:28:01	Edelwin	and we end up with skynet!

2014-06-12 11:29:52	Edelwin	:')
2014-06-12 11:29:55	dangergrrl	some of the abuse was very subtle like convincing me i was abusive when i am anything but, it took her friends telling me before i realized how confused i had gotten
2014-06-12 11:30:03	yann-kaelig	funfool, mm, ok so what happen if I emerge -1 eudev. Actually all seems working
2014-06-12 11:30:25	Ghent	dangergrrl: no, and neither are you.  People don't realize what it's like in an abusive relationship, where you love the person and you see the good side in them but you're always forced to deal with the bad side and make excuses for it
2014-06-12 11:31:05	Ghent	dangergrrl: you think to yourself that if you show them enough that you love them they'll stop being bad towards you
2014-06-12 11:31:22	funfool	that is fine if working, usually need emerge @preserved-rebuild to make transformation, if it shows nothing to do then carry on  :)
2014-06-12 11:32:08	Ghent	dangergrrl: but we digress :)
2014-06-12 11:32:15	dangergrrl	Ghent, i keep thinking it was mostly if not all because of the massive quantities of booze involved
2014-06-12 11:33:28	dangergrrl	funfool, i think mine may be working the way it's supposed to because i'm doing a server build
2014-06-12 11:33:30	Ghent	dangergrrl: well, the booze just helps it come out.  it's there without it.  you've probably heard this a million times recently, but right now, you're better off, even though it hurts.
2014-06-12 11:34:40	dangergrrl	so i have no gnomish anything trying to bring in poetteringware

2014-06-12 14:09:32	dangergrrl	when did hardened become a flavor instead of just a mixin?
2014-06-12 14:10:34	damex_	dangergrrl, what would you mix at hardened?
2014-06-12 14:11:09	dangergrrl	damex, in the funtoo profiles
2014-06-12 14:11:28	dangergrrl	it was a mixin before and now is a flavor
2014-06-12 14:12:17	dangergrrl	the core flavor is usual for servers
2014-06-12 14:12:55	dangergrrl	with some combo of server-db server-mail or server-web as common mixins

2014-06-12 14:16:25	damex_	but it still have/don't
2014-06-12 14:17:27	damex_	you can have hardened toolchain, kernel and support for pax/rbac/rsbac/grsecurity/etc/etc/etc...
2014-06-12 14:17:37	damex_	and its up to used wich features of hardened to use
2014-06-12 14:17:43	damex_	user*
2014-06-12 14:19:49	dangergrrl	damex, eselect profile
2014-06-12 14:19:54	damex_	...
2014-06-12 14:20:31	dangergrrl	hardened is now both a mixin profile and a flavor profile; as a flavor i presume it's a server build
2014-06-12 14:21:18	damex_	oh its just a funtoo way to play hardened
2014-06-12 14:22:20	dangergrrl	http://bpaste.net/show/366564/
2014-06-12 14:22:41	dangergrrl	that's on my server that has not been updated in 1.5 weeks
2014-06-12 14:23:08	damex_	i just do not use updated funtoo anymore...
2014-06-12 14:23:31	Edelwin	damex_: why?
2014-06-12 14:24:04	dangergrrl	http://bpaste.net/show/366575/ is on the vps i am rebuilding today
2014-06-12 14:24:53	damex_	Edelwin, politic on blocking/pushing things, hatred and refuse to implement wifi control via init scripts and disability to fix things by self (lets block everything. we do not care, it is gentoo to blame).
2014-06-12 14:24:58	dangergrrl	that's wierd, the unupdated one has flavor hardened also, it didn't when i started working on this, i swear
2014-06-12 14:25:11	damex_	Edelwin, maybe there was something else
2014-06-12 14:25:20	Edelwin	damex_: hmmm, what do you mean "via init scripts" ?
2014-06-12 14:25:21	damex_	this was the 1st that came to my mind
2014-06-12 14:26:39	damex_	Edelwin, there is a network configuration at the funtoo. and there is no damn way to configure wifi network via this thing. gentoo have wifi network configured via /etc/conf.d/net
2014-06-12 14:26:50	dangergrrl	anyhow funtoo has arch, build, flavor and mixin profiles, the first 3 you select one of, the mixin ones you select whichever ones you want
2014-06-12 14:27:52	damex_	you need to run crap-mananger or some other utility like wicd to manage it.
2014-06-12 14:27:54	damex_	and this is SAD!
2014-06-12 14:29:54	dangergrrl	so with hardened as mixin, you can use workstation or desktop as flavor if you want to use hardened toolchain and grsec kernel for workstation or desktop... i'm not sure what the distinction between desktop and workstation is supposed to be
2014-06-12 14:30:11	damex_	dangergrrl, you can check profiles itself
2014-06-12 14:30:22	damex_	if you interested
2014-06-12 14:30:45	dangergrrl	yes, *i* can, but i'm supposed to be able to install this before i know how to do that
2014-06-12 14:31:01	Edelwin	damex_: okay
2014-06-12 14:31:08	damex_	Edelwin, <3
2014-06-12 14:31:11	biberao	yo
2014-06-12 14:31:26	dangergrrl	as is it is unclear and not documented
2014-06-12 14:31:34	damex_	i still debating about running funtoo or gentoo on my desktop.
2014-06-12 14:31:37	damex_	im
2014-06-12 14:31:39	Edelwin	damex_: I made an edit on the wiki, about the wifi
2014-06-12 14:31:55	dangergrrl	someone must have had some idea in mind
2014-06-12 14:32:02	damex_	Edelwin, where?
2014-06-12 14:32:12	Edelwin	damex_: give me a moment

2014-06-12 14:34:30	Edelwin	I was thinking about it

2014-06-12 15:53:51	dangergrrl	turns out i can not use bliss-kernel which is what i was recommending
2014-06-12 15:54:20	sandro__	hi to All :)
2014-06-12 15:54:20	psychopa1ch	eww, not fun.  Maybe modify bliss-kernel? or are you stuck with provided kernel?
2014-06-12 15:54:29	dangergrrl	oh and it turns out that at least I do not have Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome
2014-06-12 15:55:04	dangergrrl	After the kernel is configured and built with "make", you need
2014-06-12 15:55:06	dangergrrl	    strip and compress the kernel (do not try to use the "bzimage"):
2014-06-12 15:55:06	dangergrrl	        strip vmlinux

2014-06-12 15:58:33	dangergrrl	i'd have to read the makefile
2014-06-12 15:59:23	dangergrrl	they have made output simpler from kernel make so it omits details these days
2014-06-12 15:59:36	dangergrrl	[CC] instead of the full gcc line, etc
2014-06-12 16:01:00	ℹ 	ed-210 is now known as quiznilo
2014-06-12 16:01:03	psychopa1ch	Hrm, maybe you could potentially grab a .config of his kernel?
2014-06-12 16:02:49	dangergrrl	he does provide that so i could build his with only changing the options to be a good PV Xen DomU (faster to run Xen aware kernel than non Xen aware kernel)
2014-06-12 16:04:23	dangergrrl	Xen aware guests skip having virtual hardware and make direct calls to the hypervisor, this is why Xen is faster than other virtualization solutions for running linux and bsd guest OS
2014-06-12 16:05:28	dangergrrl	you can run any kernel, but one built for xen runs much faster
2014-06-12 16:06:48	dangergrrl	I need to go spend a day at the library sometime soonish to download stuff

2014-06-12 16:08:38	dangergrrl	2560M/mo is the new "Unlimited" according to virgin mobile usa
2014-06-12 16:09:01	psychopa1ch	gah, stupid isp's and their data limits
2014-06-12 16:09:10	dangergrrl	that's obscenely low and i don't remember them telling me when they dropped to that from 5gb
2014-06-12 16:09:38	dangergrrl	i already thought 5gb was ridiculous
2014-06-12 16:10:26	dangergrrl	so, apparently i get 10 days a month at 3g speed and 256k/s the rest of the month
2014-06-12 16:11:12	dangergrrl	and i try not to do bulk transfers tethered to the phone
2014-06-12 16:13:06	dangergrrl	psychopa1ch, mobile data limits hurt extra when you're homeless, i can't order up DSL or Cable connection at the homeless shelter, i have to bring my own internet
2014-06-12 16:14:18	dangergrrl	and i have to be at the damn place at 7pm unless i go to AA or such or i have a conventional job or i attend classes of some sort at a recognized learning institution

2014-06-12 17:51:23	ZombieChicken	I had to use dmix in my asound.conf so that some other things would work
2014-06-12 17:51:48	threesixes	heh thats why i use pulse, no fuckery and everything just works
2014-06-12 17:52:25	threesixes	its a LITTLE buggy, but much better than all the work arounds and time wasted

2014-06-12 19:47:12	dantrell	vasuvi: Add "sys-power/upower-0.9.20-r1" to "/etc/portage/profile/package.provided"
2014-06-12 19:47:37	dantrell	You only removed upower because you don't use sytemd right?
2014-06-12 19:47:55	vasuvi	dantrell: thanks!  yup, using OpenRC here
2014-06-12 19:48:23	dantrell	Okay. Try seeing if that clears things up.
2014-06-12 19:49:01	vasuvi	Yup, trying "emerge -puv mate" again...
2014-06-12 19:49:25	vasuvi	The other problems remain, but now it's not complaining about upower anymore :)
2014-06-12 19:49:48	vasuvi	A lot of the other complaints seem to center on gtk-doc; hmm...
2014-06-12 19:50:36	vasuvi	I'll try upgrading it first and see if it clears that up
2014-06-12 19:51:32	dantrell	I'd help with mate but I'm actually on gnome 3.10 (without systemd). :P
2014-06-12 19:52:42	vasuvi	ok, that seemed to clear up a lot of the remainder of the problems; only a few left ( http://pastebin.com/KEwkHxUf )
2014-06-12 19:53:35	vasuvi	dantrell: well, I'd think it's more a "how to solve Portage errors" problem than a MATE problem (unless the problem is in the ebuilds), but thanks for helping me with the upower issue! :)
2014-06-12 19:53:36	threesixes	damex_, gentoos sites not resolving here
2014-06-12 19:54:17	damex_	threesixes, looks fine for 3 russian internet providers
2014-06-12 19:54:35	threesixes	wiki.gentoo.org wont resolve for me repeatedly, michigan usa
2014-06-12 19:54:45	damex_	bring your internet provider beer and ask for this stuff :P
2014-06-12 19:55:22	vasuvi	actually; I think I might have it figured out; the problem seems to be packages with new names obsoleted stuff with the old names.  so maybe I'll just unemerge the old ones first.  (shouldn't Portage handle that automatically though?)
2014-06-12 19:55:27	dantrell	dantrell: Oh I agree. Most of my "maintenance" time is spent untangling portage ebuild messes so I can get stuff installed. It's an acquired taste.
2014-06-12 19:55:57	dantrell	Did I just address myself? :D
2014-06-12 19:56:10	damex_	threesixes, what trace says?
2014-06-12 19:56:14	damex_	threesixes, whos to blame?
2014-06-12 19:56:18	dantrell	vasuvi: But yeah, portage is weird sometimes. If you understand what's going on it's pretty much better to do it manually.
2014-06-12 19:56:47	vasuvi	dantrell: indeed you did ;)  and yeah, that's what it looks like I'm going to have to do indeed...

2014-06-12 19:59:31	vasuvi	dantrell: yup, sure enough, manually unmerging the old ones first did the trick; no more blockers
2014-06-12 19:59:51	dantrell	Nice.
